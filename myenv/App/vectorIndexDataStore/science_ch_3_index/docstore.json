You have seen\n\nthat elements can be classified as metals or non-metals on the basis of\n\ntheir properties.\n\nn Think of some uses of metals and non-metals in your daily life. n What properties did you think of while categorising elements\n\nas metals or non-metals?\n\nn How are these properties related to the uses of these elements? Let us look at some of these properties in detail.\n\nAL PROPERTIES AL PROPERTIES 3.1 PHYSIC 3.1 PHYSIC AL PROPERTIES 3.1 PHYSIC AL PROPERTIES AL PROPERTIES 3.1 PHYSIC 3.1 PHYSIC\n\n3.1.1 Metals\n\nThe easiest way to start grouping substances is by comparing their physical properties. Let us study this with the help of the following activities. For performing Activities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of following metals \u2013 iron, copper, aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead, zinc and any other metal that is easily available.\n\nActivity 3.1 Activity 3.1 Activity 3.1 Activity 3.1 Activity 3.1\n\nn Take samples of iron, copper, aluminium and magnesium. Note\n\nthe appearance of each sample.\n\nn Clean the surface of each sample by rubbing them with sand paper\n\nand note their appearance again.\n\nMetals, in their pure state, have a shining surface. This property is\n\ncalled metallic lustre.\n\nActivity 3.2 Activity 3.2 Activity 3.2 Activity 3.2 Activity 3.2\n\nn Take small pieces of iron, copper, aluminium, and magnesium. Try to cut these metals with a sharp knife and note your observations.\n\nn Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair of tongs. CAUTION: Always handle sodium metal with care. Dry it by pressing between the folds of a filter paper.\n\nn Put it on a watch-glass and try to cut it with a knife. n What do you observe?\n\nRationalised 2023-24\n\nYou will find that metals are generally hard. The hardness varies\n\nfrom metal to metal.\n\nActivity 3.3 Activity 3.3 Activity 3.3 Activity 3.3 Activity 3.3\n\nn Take pieces of iron, zinc, lead and copper. n Place any one metal on a block of iron and strike it four or five\n\ntimes with a hammer. What do you observe?\n\nn Repeat with other metals. n Record the change in the shape of these metals.\n\nYou will find that some metals can be beaten into thin sheets. This property is called malleability. Did you know that gold and silver are the most malleable metals?\n\nActivity 3.4 Activity 3.4 Activity 3.4 Activity 3.4 Activity 3.4\n\nn List the metals whose wires you have seen in daily life.\n\nThe ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility. Gold is the most ductile metal. You will be surprised to know that a wire of about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold.\n\nIt is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be\n\ngiven different shapes according to our needs.\n\nCan you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels? Do you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do the following Activity to find out the answer.\n\nActivity 3.5 Activity 3.5 Activity 3.5 Activity 3.5 Activity 3.5\n\nn Take an aluminium or copper wire. Clamp this wire on a stand, as shown in Fig. 3.1. n Fix a pin to the free end of the\n\nwire using wax.\n\nn Heat the wire with a spirit lamp, candle or a burner near the place where it is clamped. n What do you observe after some\n\ntime?\n\nn Note your observations. Does\n\nthe metal wire melt?\n\nFigure 3.1 Figure 3.1 Figure 3.1 Figure 3.1 Figure 3.1 Metals are good conductors of heat.\n\nThe above activity shows that metals are good conductors of heat and have high melting points.

Do they produce a sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface are said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of metals?\n\n3.1.2 Non-metals\n\nIn the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals as compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon, sulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The non-metals are either solids or gases except bromine which is a liquid.\n\nDo non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals?\n\nLet us find out.\n\nActivity 3.7 Activity 3.7 Activity 3.7 Activity 3.7 Activity 3.7\n\nn Collect samples of carbon (coal or graphite), sulphur and iodine. n Carry out the Activities 3.1 to 3.4 and 3.6 with these non-metals\n\nand record your observations.\n\nCompile your observations regarding metals and non-metals in Table 3.1.\n\nTable 3.1\n\nElement Symbol Type of Hardness Malleability Ductility\n\nConducts Electricity\n\nSonority\n\nsurface\n\nOn the bases of the observations recorded in Table 3.1, discuss the general physical properties of metals and non-metals in the class. You must have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their physical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example \u2013\n\n(i) All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature.

These two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm. Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.\n\n(ii) (iii) Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each form is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is the hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting and boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a conductor of electricity.\n\n(iv) Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they can be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting points.\n\nElements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals\n\non the basis of their chemical properties.\n\nActivity 3.8 Activity 3.8 Activity 3.8 Activity 3.8 Activity 3.8\n\nn Take a magnesium ribbon and some sulphur powder. n Burn the magnesium ribbon.

Let us check by performing the following Activity.\n\nActivity 3.9 Activity 3.9 Activity 3.9 Activity 3.9 Activity 3.9\n\nCAUTION: The following activity needs the teacher\u2019s assistance. It would be better if students wear eye protection.\n\nn Hold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try\n\nburning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples.\n\nn Collect the product if formed. n Let the products and the metal surface cool down. n Which metals burn easily? n What flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt? n How does the metal surface appear after burning? n Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity\n\ntowards oxygen.\n\nn Are the products soluble in water?\n\nAlmost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides. Metal + Oxygen \u2192 Metal oxide\n\nFor example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen\n\nto form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.\n\n2Cu + O2 \u2192 2CuO (Copper)\n\n(Copper(II) oxide)\n\nSimilarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.\n\n+ 3O2 \u2192 2Al2O3\n\n4Al (Aluminium)\n\n(Aluminium oxide)\n\nRecall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid. We have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal oxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as basic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as bases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides. Aluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases \u2013\n\nAl2O3 + 6HCl \u2192 2AlCl3 + 3H2O Al2O3 + 2NaOH \u2192 2NaAlO2 + H2O\n\n(Sodium aluminate)\n\nMost metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve in water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in water to produce alkalis as follows \u2013 Na2O(s) + H2O(l) \u2192 2NaOH(aq) K2O(s) + H2O(l) \u2192 2KOH(aq)\n\n41\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\nRationalised 2023-24\n\nWe have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not react with oxygen at the same rate.

Metals such as potassium and sodium react so vigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them and to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil. At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium, aluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The protective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron does not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled in the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is coated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do not react with oxygen even at high temperatures.\n\n? w o n K u o Y o D\n\nAnodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium develops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it resistant to further corrosion. The resistance can be improved further by making the oxide layer thicker. During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode reacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer. This oxide layer can be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\n\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of magnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium. But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of zinc, iron, copper or lead.

We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements as a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\n\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\n\nsome metals and non-metals.\n\nWe can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its outermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell now becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus of this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has become 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation Na+.

Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible due to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten state.

These minerals are called ores.\n\n3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\n\nYou have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this knowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its ore. Some metals are found in the earth\u2019s crust in the free state. Some are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\n49\n\nRationalised 2023-24\n\nstate. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the free state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as their sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series (K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in nature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series (Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth\u2019s crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that the ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very reactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\n\nK\n\nNa\n\nElectrolysis\n\nCa\n\nMg\n\nAl\n\nZn\n\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the following three categories (Fig. 3.9) \u2013 (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals of medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques are to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.\n\nFe\n\nReduction using carbon\n\nPb\n\nCu\n\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from ores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is explained in detail in the following sections.\n\nAg\n\nFound in native state\n\nAu\n\nFigure 3.9 Figure 3.9 Figure 3.9 Figure 3.9 Figure 3.9 Activity series and related metallurgy\n\nFigure 3.10 Figure 3.10 Figure 3.10 Steps involved in the extraction of metals from ores Figure 3.10 Figure 3.10\n\n3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores\n\nOres mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts of impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must be removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes\n\nScience\n\n50\n\nRationalised 2023-24\n\nused for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore. Different separation techniques are accordingly employed.\n\n3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\n\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these metals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar (HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted into mercuric oxide (HgO).

These are usually present as sulphides or carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction, the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly in the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited air. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown as follows \u2013 Roasting\n\nHeat\uf8e7\n\n\u2192\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g)\n\n2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)\n\n2\n\n2\n\nCalcination\n\nHeat\uf8e7\n\n\u2192\uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\n\nZnCO (s) The metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by using suitable reducing agents such as carbon.

Obtaining metals from their compounds is also a reduction process.\n\nBesides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals, sometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive metals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n\n51\n\nRationalised 2023-24\n\nagents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their compounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with aluminium powder, the following reaction takes place \u2013 3MnO2(s) + 4Al(s) \u2192 3Mn(l) + 2Al2O3(s) + Heat\n\nCan you identify the substances that are getting oxidised\n\nand reduced?\n\nThese displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The amount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced in the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) with aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked machine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.\n\nFe2O3(s) + 2Al(s) \u2192 2Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) + Heat\n\n3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the Top of the\n\nActivity Series\n\nFigure 3.11 Figure 3.11 Figure 3.11 Figure 3.11 Figure 3.11 Thermit process for joining railway tracks\n\nThe metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example, carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium, aluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained by electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals are deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas, chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode).

The galvanised article is protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you reason this out?\n\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal. We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is the most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is because pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is mixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard and strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance. The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non- metal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then, dissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled to room temperature.\n\n? w o n K u o Y o D\n\nPure gold, known as 24 carat gold, is very soft. It is, therefore, not suitable for making jewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India, 22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is alloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver.\n\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an amalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is less than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and zinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are not good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making electrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low melting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.\n\n!\n\nw o n K o t e r o M\n\nThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\n\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more than 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India. They had developed a process which prevented iron from rusting. For its quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists from all parts of the world.
