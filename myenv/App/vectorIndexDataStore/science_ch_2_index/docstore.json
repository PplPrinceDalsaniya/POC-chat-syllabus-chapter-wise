It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of water.

We have also learnt in the previous section about dilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH\u2013 ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\n\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\n\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for \u2018potenz\u2019 in German, meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher the hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\n\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it represents an increase in OH\u2013 ion concentration in the solution, that is, increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\n\nFigure 2.6 Figure 2.6 Figure 2.6 Variation of pH with the change in concentration of H+(aq) and OH\u2013(aq) ions Figure 2.6 Figure 2.6\n\n25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n\nRationalised 2023-24\n\nTable 2.2\n\nS.

Our body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is less than 5.6, it is called acid rain.

It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach. During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes pain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called antacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the beginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid. Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for this purpose.\n\npH change as the cause of tooth decay Tooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth enamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium phosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in water, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5.

Sodium chloride is separated from these salts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in several parts of the world. These large crystals are often brown due to impurities. This is called rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed when seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt is mined like coal.\n\nYou must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Dandi March.

Let us see how one substance is used for making all these different substances.\n\nSodium hydroxide When electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium chloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The process is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed\u2013 chlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide. 2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) \u2192 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g) Chlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode. Sodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three products produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the different uses of these products.\n\nFigure 2.8 Figure 2.8 Figure 2.8 Important products from the chlor-alkali process Figure 2.8 Figure 2.8\n\nBleaching powder You have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used for the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced by the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2].
