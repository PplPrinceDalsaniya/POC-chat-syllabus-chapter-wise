Most dams have a section called a spillway or weir over which or through which it is intended that water will flow either intermittently or continuously. Dams are classified according to structure, intended purpose or height. Based on structure and the materials used, dams are classified as timber dams, embankment dams or masonry dams, with several subtypes. According to the height, dams can be categorised as large dams and major dams or alternatively as low dams, medium height dams and high dams.\n\nIn the 11th Century, Bhopal Lake, one of the largest artificial lakes", "start_char_idx": 3998, "end_char_idx": 7944, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4101f98-fe76-4b80-914d-255ec49d5685": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4101f98-fe76-4b80-914d-255ec49d5685", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d1a2f34-da1f-4ef7-bdf4-dfc08810aa57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "97760a9d52951a13cf77d83953cac9c5e21c2b3cbcd0e46f42d30ace1d436f4c"}, "2": {"node_id": "52e66e09-429b-4627-b6ae-41ab08bb0925", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b68ae56d67b92ed867d74c95c29fa063628975bca553cfb3dd962f8ba24871f"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ca36582-63ae-4406-94d8-b073bf9a0794", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9727b4254a329dc0c0c71c35b693d95986aff36fec19f39aef60ace020fcf665"}}, "hash": "c04ce048f15ff5aed24ac9f7b6f444e5f01e702e591c608a4680b552c6bc7bac", "text": "the 11th Century, Bhopal Lake, one of the largest artificial lakes of its time was built. \u2022 In the 14th Century, the tank in Hauz Khas, Delhi was constructed by Iltutmish for supplying water to Siri Fort area.\n\nSource: Dying Wisdom, CSE, 1997.\n\nhandicap of its colonial past.

Dams were traditionally built to impound rivers and rainwater that could be used later to irrigate agricultural fields. Today, dams are built not just for irrigation but for electricity generation, water supply for domestic and industrial uses, flood control, recreation, inland navigation and fish breeding. Hence, dams are now referred to as multi-purpose projects where the many uses of the impounded water are integrated with one another. For example, in the Sutluj-Beas river basin, the Bhakra \u2013 Nangal project water is being used both for hydel power production and irrigation. Similarly, the Hirakud project in the Mahanadi basin integrates conservation of water with flood control.\n\nWe have sown the crops in Asar We will bring Bhadu in Bhadra Floods have swollen the Damodar The sailing boats cannot sail Oh!

This has great ecological consequences like salinisation of the soil. At the same time, it has transformed the social landscape i.e. increasing the social gap between the richer landowners and the landless poor.

Ironically, the dams that were constructed to control floods have triggered floods due to sedimentation in the reservoir. Moreover, the big dams have mostly been unsuccessful in controlling floods at the time of excessive rainfall. You may have seen or read how the release of water from dams during heavy rains aggravated the flood situation in Maharashtra and Gujarat in 2006. The floods have not only devastated life and property but also caused extensive soil erosion. Sedimentation also meant that the flood plains were deprived of silt, a natural fertiliser, further adding on to the problem of land degradation. It was also observed that induced the multi-purpose projects earthquakes, caused water-borne diseases and pests and pollution resulting from excessive use of water.\n\nMany thought that given the disadvantages and rising resistance against the multi- purpose projects, water harvesting system was a viable alternative, both socio-economically and environmentally. In ancient India, along with the sophisticated hydraulic structures, there existed an extraordinary tradition of water-harvesting system.

In Gendathur, a remote backward village in Mysuru, Karnataka, villagers have installed, in their household\u2019s rooftop, rainwater harvesting system to meet their water needs. Nearly 200 households have installed this system and the village has earned the rare distinction of being rich in rainwater. See Fig. 3.6 for a better understanding of the rooftop rainwater harvesting system which is adapted here. Gendathur receives an annual precipitation of 1,000 mm, and with 80 per cent of collection efficiency and of about 10 fillings, every house can collect and use about 50,000 litres of water annually. From the 200 houses, the net amount of rainwater harvested annually amounts to 1,00,000 litres.\n\nA kul leads to a circular village tank, as the above in the Kaza village, from which water is released as and when required.\n\nFig 3.5: Traditional method of rainwater harvesting\n\nparticularly in the summers. Rainwater, or palar pani, as commonly referred to in these parts, is considered the purest form of natural water. Many houses constructed underground rooms adjoining the \u2018tanka\u2019 to beat the summer heat as it would keep the room cool.\n\nRooftop rainwater harvesting is the most common practice in Shillong, Meghalaya. It is interesting because Cherapunjee and Mawsynram situated at a distance of 55 km. from Shillong receive the highest rainfall in the world,", "start_char_idx": 15766, "end_char_idx": 19368, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60a1d072-ced4-4336-b4ca-d45eaa9f46c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "60a1d072-ced4-4336-b4ca-d45eaa9f46c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d1a2f34-da1f-4ef7-bdf4-dfc08810aa57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "97760a9d52951a13cf77d83953cac9c5e21c2b3cbcd0e46f42d30ace1d436f4c"}, "2": {"node_id": "62740aa9-0e3f-41fb-841f-25d635c55252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f0e60ae162e8216ca44e4fb12af44236c4a425a5ba919508953286096383875"}, "3": {"node_id": "c807930f-28d6-40a9-95c4-fca709f2ce9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b33a7da0b40b9a9e8f51146fe0fc6ee1b2c94d1fd00027db8e6773d20a98d6b6"}}, "hash": "689ba429df261ecc6e1623bfa9c8dcfd1501f0727c90c9c64771b74307119692", "text": "a distance of 55 km. from Shillong receive the highest rainfall in the world, yet the state capital Shillong faces acute shortage of water. Nearly every household in the city has a rooftop rainwater harvesting structure. Nearly 15-25 per cent of the total water requirement of the household comes from rooftop water harvesting.\n\nRooftop harvesting was common across the towns and villages of the Thar. Rainwater that falls on the sloping roofs of houses is taken through a pipe into an underground tanka (circular holes in the ground). built in the main house or in the courtyard. The picture above shows water being taken from a neighbour\u2019s roof through a long pipe. Here the neighbour\u2019s rooftop has been used for collection of rainwater. The picture shows a hole through which rainwater flows down into an underground tanka.\n\nFind out other rainwater harvesting systems existing in and around your locality.\n\nFig. 3.6\n\nToday, in western Rajasthan, sadly the practice of rooftop rainwater harvesting is on the decline as plenty of water is available due to the perennial Indira Gandhi Canal, though some houses still maintain the tankas since they do not like the taste of tap water.\n\nTamil Nadu is the first state in India which has made rooftop rainwater harvesting structure compulsory to all the houses across the state. There are legal provisions to punish the defaulters.\n\nWATER RESOURCES\n\n27\n\nRationalised-2023-24\n\nBAMBOO DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEM\n\nIn Meghalaya, a 200-year-old system of tapping stream and spring water by using bamboo pipes, is prevalent. About 18-20 litres of water enters the bamboo pipe system, gets transported over hundreds of metres, and finally reduces to 20-80 drops per minute at the site of the plant.\n\nPicture 1: Bamboo pipes are used to divert perennial springs on the hilltops to the lower reaches by gravity.\n\nPicture 4: If the pipes pass a road, they are taken high above the land.\n\nPicture 2 and 3: The channel sections, made of bamboo, divert water to the plant site where it is distributed into branches, again made and laid out with different forms of bamboo pipes. The flow of water into the pipes is controlled by manipulating the pipe positions.\n\nPicture 5 and 6 Reduced channel sections and diversion units are used at the last stage of water application. The last channel section enables water to be dropped near the roots of the plant.\n\nFig 3.7\n\n1. Collect information on how industries are polluting our water resources. 2.
