All the interacting organisms in an\narea together with the non-living constituents of the environment form\nan ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components\ncomprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising\nphysical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals.\nFor example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such\nas grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;\nand animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms\ninteract with each other and their growth, reproduction and other\nactivities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden\nis an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes.\nThese are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are human-\nmade (artificial) ecosystems.\n/square6You might have seen an aquarium.

Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll?

This series or or ganisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1).\nEach step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level.\nThe autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.\nThey fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).\nWe know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to pr ovide us\nenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy from\none component of the system to another . As we have studied,\nthe autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and\nconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the\nactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nto the heter otrophs and decomposers. However , as we saw in\nthe previous Chapter on \u2018Sources of Energy\u2019, when one form\nof ener gy is changed to another , some ener gy is lost to the\nenvironment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow\nof energy between various components of the environment\nhas been extensively studied and it has been found that \u2013\n/square6The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about\n1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it\ninto food energy.\n/square6When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal\nof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes\ninto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned\ninto its own body and made available for the next level of\nconsumers.\n/square6Therefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount\nof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next\nlevel of consumers.\n/square6Since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,\nfood chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss\nof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy\nremains after four trophic levels.\n/square6There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the\nproducers.\n/square6The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in\nturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight\nline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching\nlines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1Figure 13.1\nFood chain in nature\n(a) in forest, (b) in\ngrassland and (c) in a\npond\nRationalised 2023-24", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2985, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ce32422-b002-4aa8-a949-142c8a3db71f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ce32422-b002-4aa8-a949-142c8a3db71f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "science_ch_13.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7936d3d9-144c-4e2d-abe4-49a675238afb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "science_ch_13.pdf"}, "hash": "b80b26c3c1dd70632f8495d0b286a7992ada00b3766739d2fa9c22a4f2dc5fac"}}, "hash": "0802271a8519484b51f1cf2fa6526f6122f926f7fc0c68c4ab11b460bbe4922c", "text": "Our Environment 211From the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),\ntwo things become clear . Firstly, the flow of\nenergy is unidirectional. The energy that is\ncaptured by the autotrophs does not revert\nback to the solar input and the energy which\npasses to the herbivores does not come back\nto autotrophs. As it moves progressively\nthrough the various trophic levels it is no\nlonger available to the previous level.\nSecondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level.\nAnother interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. Y ou have read in Class IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests.\nThese chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\nFigure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Figure 13.4  Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystemFigure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3Figure 13.3\nFood web, consisting of\nmany food chains\nRationalised 2023-24", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1273, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2259a530-6731-4386-9f2b-170ba55392ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "2259a530-6731-4386-9f2b-170ba55392ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "science_ch_13.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "766feabc-8ae6-4a9f-85a0-6b8e59609af2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "science_ch_13.pdf"}, "hash": "13293651e0af1decd51a6836fb5385e4f4ca09e521aa9a2320634abd679e4219"}}, "hash": "79f5a168e41624c6013ac90d73c15a499965e2b192de2f07d3bb904f70483edd", "text": "Science 212Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3Activity 13.3and animals.

While O2,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However , at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun.

W e have also lear nt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH\u2013 ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator , which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for \u2018 potenz \u2019 in German,\nmeaning power . On the pH scale we can measur e pH generally fr om\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. V alues less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH\u2013 ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.QUESTIONS\n?1.

It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.\nDuring indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter . These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater , but is corr oded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are\ngenerally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and\nprevent tooth decay.\nSelf defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare\nHave you ever been stung by a honey-bee?

Different metals show different reactivities\ntowards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the bur ner. Copper does not bur n, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.Do Y ou Know?Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air . This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the\noxide layer thicker .  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker pr otective oxide layer .  This oxide layer can\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here.

W e, ther efore, explain the r eactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals.\nWe can see fr om Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electr on in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet.

The metals in the middle of the activity series\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth\u2019s\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates.

A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10.

The oxides of these\nmetals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mer cury. When it is heated in air , it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO).

These ar e usually pr esent as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the pr esence of excess air . This pr ocess is known as r oasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This pr ocess is known as calcination. The chemical r eaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows \u2013\nRoasting\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g) 2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)2 2Heat\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7\uf8e7\nCalcination\nZnCO (s) ZnO(s) + CO (g)3 2Heat\uf8e7 \u2192 \uf8e7\uf8e7 \uf8e7\nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon.

They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode).

It is, therefore, not suitable for making\njewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver .\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical cir cuits. Solder , an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wir es together .\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desir ed pr operties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature.\nIron pillar at DelhiThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more\nthan 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.  They had\ndeveloped a process which prevented iron from rusting. For\nits quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists\nfrom all parts of the world.

Dams\nwere traditionally built to impound rivers and\nrainwater that could be used later to irrigate\nagricultural fields. Today, dams are built not\njust for irrigation but for electricity generation,\nwater supply for domestic and industrial\nuses, flood control, recreation, inland\nnavigation and fish breeding. Hence, dams are\nnow referred to as multi-purpose projects\nwhere the many uses of the impounded water\nare integrated with one another . For example,\nin the Sutluj-Beas river basin, the Bhakra \u2013\nNangal project water is being used both for\nhydel power production and irrigation.\nSimilarly, the Hirakud project in the\nMahanadi basin integrates conservation of\nwater with flood control.\nMulti-purpose projects, launched after\nIndependence with their integrated water\nresources management approach, were thought\nof as the vehicle that would lead the nation to\ndevelopment and progress, overcoming thehandicap of its colonial past. Jawaharlal Nehru\nproudly proclaimed the dams as the \u2018temples of\nmodern India\u2019; the reason being that it would\nintegrate development of agriculture and the\nvillage economy with rapid industrialisation and\ngrowth of the urban economy.\nFig. 3.2:  Hirakud Dam\nWe have sown the crops in Asar\nWe will bring Bhadu in Bhadra\nFloods have swollen the Damodar\nThe sailing boats cannot sail\nOh!

Most dams have a section called a\nspillway or weir  over which or through which\nit is intended that water will flow either\nintermittently or continuously . Dams are\nclassified according to structure, intended\npurpose or height. Based on structure and\nthe materials used, dams are classified as\ntimber dams, embankment dams or masonry\ndams, with several subtypes.

Over these years, cultivation\nmethods have changed significantly depending\nupon the characteristics of physical\nenvironment, technological know-how and\nsocio-cultural practices. Far ming varies fr om\nsubsistence to commercial type. At present,\nin dif ferent parts of India, the following\nfarming systems are practised.\nPrimitive Subsistence Farming\nThis type of farming is still practised in few\npockets of India. Primitive subsistence\nagriculture is practised on small patches of\nland with the help of primitive tools like hoe,\ndao and digging sticks, and family/\ncommunity labour . This type of far ming\ndepends upon monsoon, natural fertility of\nthe soil and suitability of other environmental\nconditions to the crops grown.\nIt is a \u2018slash and bur n\u2019 agricultur e.\nFarmers clear a patch of land and pr oduce\ncereals and other food crops to sustain their\nfamily. When the soil fertility decr eases, the\nfarmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land\nfor cultivation. This type of shifting allows\nNature to replenish the fertility of the soilthrough natural processes; land productivity\nin this type of agriculture is low as the farmer\ndoes not use fertilisers or other modern\ninputs. It is known by dif ferent names in\ndifferent parts of the country.\nCan you name  some such types of farmings?\nIt is jhumming \nin north-easter n states like\nAssam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland;\nPamlou in Manipur , Dipa in Bastar district\nof Chhattishgar h, and in Andaman and\nNicobar Islands.\nJhumming:  The \u2018slash and burn \u2019 agriculture\nis known as \u2018Milpa\u2019 in Mexico and Central\nAmerica, \u2018Conuco\u2019 in V enzuela, \u2018R oca\u2019 in\nBrazil, \u2018Masole\u2019 in Central Africa, \u2018Ladang\u2019\nin Indonesia, \u2018Ray \u2019 in Vietnam.\nIn India, this primitive form of cultivation\nis called \u2018Bewar \u2019 or \u2018Dahiya \u2019 in Madhya\nPradesh, \u2018Podu\u2019 or \u2018Penda\u2019 in Andhra Pradesh,\n\u2018Pama Dabi\u2019 or \u2018K oman \u2019 or Bringa \u2019 in Odisha,\n\u2018Kumari\u2019 in W estern Ghats, \u2018 Valre\u2019 or \u2018 Waltre\u2019\nin South-eastern Rajasthan, \u2018Khil\u2019 in the\nHimalayan belt, \u2018Kuruwa\u2019 in Jharkhand, and\n\u2018Jhumming\u2019 in the North- eastern region.\nFig. 4.1\nRationalised-2023-24", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2584, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "261c65ee-56e8-40d0-b4fd-ab143300d36c": {"__data__": {"id_": "261c65ee-56e8-40d0-b4fd-ab143300d36c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "socialscience_ch_4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6569b476-67fa-434d-900e-5f820611b3ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "socialscience_ch_4.pdf"}, "hash": "a689ed7ddccbcbe3371e630d2a54a8d383d3c9f046d88ea4040ed519016a9bd3"}}, "hash": "03bbdaee75aad81dd79d0ff9b9bba00ce9089c6d2ca4c6f7f0bde4b3c3be3d9d", "text": "Can you name the type of farming Rinjha\u2019s\nfamily is engaged in?\nCan you enlist some crops which are grown\nin such farming?\nIntensive Subsistence Farming\nThis type of farming is practised in areas of\nhigh population pr essur e on land.

The degr ee of\ncommercialisation of agriculture varies from\none r egion to another .

In this type of farming, a single crop\nis grown on a large area. The plantation has\nan inter face of agricultur e and industry.\nPlantations cover large tracts of land, using\ncapital intensive inputs, with the help of\nmigrant labour ers.

However , some of these\nare also used as raw material in the\nproduction of soap, cosmetics and ointments.\nGroundnut is a kharif crop and accounts\nfor about half of the major oilseeds produced in\nthe country. Gujarat was the largest producer\nof groundnut followed by Rajasthan and Tamil\nNadu  in 201 9\u201320. Linseed and mustard are rabi\ncrops. Sesamum is a kharif crop in north and\nrabi crop in south India. Castor seed is grown\nboth as rabi and kharif crop.\nTea:  Tea cultivation is an example of\nplantation agriculture. It is also an important\nbeverage crop introduced in India initially by\nthe British. Today, most of the tea plantations\nare owned by Indians. The tea plant grows\nwell in tropical and sub-tropical climates\nendowed with deep and fertile well-drained\nsoil, rich in humus and or ganic matter . Tea\nbushes require warm and moist frost-free\nFig. 4.9:   Groundnut, sunflower and mustard are ready to be harvested in the fieldPulses:  India is the largest producer as well\nas the consumer of pulses in the world. These\nare the major source of protein in a vegetarian\ndiet. Major pulses that are grown in India are\ntur (ar har), urad, moong, masur , peas and\ngram. Can you distinguish which of these\npulses are grown in the kharif season and\nwhich are grown in the rabi season? Pulses\nneed less moisture and survive even in dry\nconditions. Being leguminous crops, all these\ncrops except arhar help in restoring soil\nfertility by fixing nitr ogen fr om the air .\nTherefore, these are mostly grown in rotation\nwith other crops. Major pulse producing states\nin India  are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,\nMaharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Kar nataka.\nFood Crops other than Grains\nSugarcane:  It is a tropical as well as a\nsubtropical crop. It grows well in hot and\nhumid climate with a temperature of 21 \u00b0C to\n27\u00b0C and an annual rainfall between 75cm.\nand 100cm. Irrigation is required in the\nregions of low rainfall. It can be grown on a\nvariety of soils and needs manual labour from\nFig. 4.8:   Sugarcane Cultivation\nRationalised-2023-24", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2881, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7adc80d0-c5c6-4fbb-93c5-d1773a5fba3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7adc80d0-c5c6-4fbb-93c5-d1773a5fba3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "socialscience_ch_4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8f4157d1-14ca-44bc-867d-e078781cd983", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "socialscience_ch_4.pdf"}, "hash": "aad4966b89426941fb59eb7e3a643ae2ab51b7da91d04f2bffe43595418ca512"}}, "hash": "840cd5089f1f5f2098644de7a9256c03a443580532e66219fd8a517efed23b25", "text": "37 AGRICULTURE\nclimate all through the\nyear.

It requires moist and\nhumid climate with rainfall of more than 200\ncm. and temperature above 25\u00b0C.\nRubber is an important industrial raw\nmaterial. It is mainly grown in Kerala, Tamil\nNadu, Karnataka and Andaman and Nic obar\nislands and  Garo hills of Meghalaya.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil\nNadu, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.\nJute:  It is known as the golden fibre. Jute grows\nwell on well-drained fertile soils in the flood\nplains wher e soils ar e renewed every year . High\ntemperature is required during the time of\ngrowth. W est Bengal, Bihar , Assam, O disha and\nMeghalaya are the major jute producing states.\nIt is used in making gunny bag\ns, mats, ropes,\nyarn, carpets and other artefacts. Due to its\nhigh cost, it is losing market to synthetic fibres\nand packing materials, particularly the nylon.\nTechnological and Institutional Reforms\nIt was mentioned in the previous pages that\nagriculture has been practised in India for\nthousands of years. Sustained uses of land\nwithout compatible techno-institutional\nchanges have hindered the pace of agricultural\ndevelopment. Inspite of development of sources\nof irrigation most of the farmers in large parts\nof the country still depend upon monsoon and\nnatural fertility in order to carry on their\nagriculture. For a growing population, this\nposes a serious challenge. Agriculture which\nprovides livelihood for more than 60 per cent\nof its population, needs some serious technical\nand institutional reforms. Thus, collectivisation,\nconsolidation of holdings, cooperation and\nabolition of zamindari, etc. were given priority\nto bring about institutional reforms in the\ncountry after Independence. \u2018Land reform\u2019 was\nthe main focus of our First Five Y ear Plan. The\nright of inheritance had already lead to\nfragmentation of land holdings necessitating\nconsolidation of holdings.\nThe laws of land reforms were enacted but\nthe implementation was lacking or lukewarm.\nThe Government of India embarked upon\nintroducing agricultural reforms to improve\nIndian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe Green Revolution based on the use of\npackage technology and the White Revolution\n(Operation Flood) were some of the strategies\ninitiated to improve the lot of Indian agriculture.\nBut, this too led to the concentration of\ndevelopment in few selected areas. Therefore,\nin the 1980s and 1990s, a comprehensive land\ndevelopment programme was initiated, which\nincluded both institutional and technical\nFig. 4.14:   Cotton CultivationFibre Crops:  Cotton, jute, hemp and natural\nsilk are the four major fibre crops grown in India.\nThe first three are derived from the crops grown\nin the soil, the latter is obtained from cocoons of\nthe silkworms fed on green leaves specially\nmulberry. Rearing of silk worms for the\nproduction of silk fibre is known as sericulture .\nCotton:  India is believed to be the original home\nof the cotton plant. Cotton is one of the main\nraw materials for cotton textile industry. In\n2017, India was second largest producer of\ncotton after China.  Cotton grows well in drier\nparts of the black cotton soil of the Deccan\nplateau. It requires high temperature, light\nrainfall or irrigation, 210 frost-free days and\nbright sun-shine for its growth. It is a kharif\ncrop and requires 6 to 8 months to mature.\nMajor", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3553, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ba12c39-5c80-484f-9d80-5d99145b7b07": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ba12c39-5c80-484f-9d80-5d99145b7b07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "socialscience_ch_4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c83c5ef9-09e6-4923-95ad-9aace8c76ea7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "socialscience_ch_4.pdf"}, "hash": "9abd0b57ad6a831d7f1bb9482e8885da455c3d7e12bf51ab5107e2978abb9b29"}, "2": {"node_id": "2124f383-8058-4404-a2ff-1723857e53dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "socialscience_ch_4.pdf"}, "hash": "08eb21cea1390c31daf5d430d118f9553b59d2632083335572397bec150ab713"}}, "hash": "c2e80baa78d5bac2055c02ee6c4eb925d5d130d4307d3c8488a4148cfe8d033b", "text": "It is a kharif\ncrop and requires 6 to 8 months to mature.\nMajor cotton-producing states are\u2013\nMaharashtra,  Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,\nList the items which are made of rubber and\nare used by us.\nRationalised-2023-24", "start_char_idx": 3490, "end_char_idx": 3702, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c26bd322-d412-4653-ae18-9938713506be": {"__data__": {"id_": "c26bd322-d412-4653-ae18-9938713506be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "socialscience_ch_4.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3471de9f-2004-4091-b4a1-5253f6b8a93d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "socialscience_ch_4.pdf"}, "hash": "c51f7c16707de9215c14925ea151c0964a34d8845b308898d96dcb5616a417bd"}}, "hash": "0999053f6238f8c2d9848773c4155787e59ab44f5359bd9ba7a0ec3a6c7797ce", "text": "39 AGRICULTURE\nFig. 4.15:   Modern technological equipments used in agriculture\nreforms.
